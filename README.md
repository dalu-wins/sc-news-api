## üóÑÔ∏è Public API

A public API is hosted on my server:
- [https://sc-news.api.dalu-wins.de/](https://sc-news.api.dalu-wins.de/)

While the API should handle concurrent access safely, please **avoid unnecessary request spamming** to keep the service stable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

For an easy setup, use Docker Compose.  

### Steps

By default, the API container exposes port 8000 **only to other Docker containers**.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dalu-wins/sc-news-api.git

# Go into the project folder
cd sc-news-api

# Build and start the API container in detached mode
docker compose up --build -d
```

> Note: Android requires HTTPS to access the API.
