Provide information to the [SC-News](https://github.com/dalu-wins/sc-news) app.

## üìù Variables
| Variable | Description |
--- | ---
max_patches | Set the limit of patches that the api will return

## üóÑÔ∏è Server
The public API is hosted on my homepage:
- [https://www.dalu-wins.de/](https://www.dalu-wins.de/)
- [https://api.dalu-wins.de/sc-news](https://api.dalu-wins.de/sc-news)

The API implements caching and concurrency protection:
- Scraped results are cached for **5 minutes**.
- Only **one scraping job** can run at a time.
- If multiple clients call the API simultaneously, subsequent requests **wait** for the first scrape to finish and then **read from the cache**.
- This means that **at most one scrape per 10 minutes** is performed, minimizing load on Spectrum.

While the API should handle concurrent access safely, please **avoid unnecessary request spamming** to keep the service stable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Make sure you have installed `python3` beforehand. You might need to run the python steps fromS `venv`.

### Clone repo & install requirements
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/dalu-wins/sc-news-api.git

# Install python requirements
cd sc-news-api/src
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Chromium, wget, unzip
```bash
# Update if necessary
sudo apt update

# Install requirements
sudo apt install chromium -y
sudo apt install wget -y
sudo apt install unzip -y
```

### Download, unzip & place Chrome Driver in repo's root directory
```bash
# Important: Match Chrome Driver version with your chromium version!
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/141.0.7390.122/linux64/chromedriver-linux64.zip

# Unzip, move & make executable
unzip chromedriver-linux64.zip
mv chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver .
chmod +x chromedriver

# Remove unnecessary files
rm -rf chromedriver-linux64 chromedriver-linux64.zip
```

### Start server
```bash
# Adjust host and port if needed
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Now you should be able to check if the api is correctly running with ```http://localhost:8000?max_patches=10```
